# 2019-SEC-FormADV-WebApp

The plan is to make a competitive, more cost efficient web app than RIA Database or Discovery Database.


Individual Goals:

1. Have all RIA firms in the United States mapped. 

2. Be able to see some sort of National Breakdown (this is down the road a bit)

3. Filter by state and be brought to an individual state map 

4. Each firm while hovering on Ria map point will display the immediately prudent info (Total AUM, Number of Employees, Number of Clients, Percentage of clients by client type etc)...basically the most immediately interesting info without putting too much that the tool tip is distracting. 

5. Clicking on the firm will reveal a breakdown for that individual firm. Maybe a pie chart or bar charts showing type of clients vs. total clients, an infographic (maybe just a little box) which displays the ways in which the firm is compensated (the whole deal with compensated by: percentage of AUM, hourly fees etc)

6. Add an option to output the raw meta data based on the current level of filtration the user is at. 
So if the user is for example looking currently at New Mexico RIA firms and they are looking at the top 100 based on total AUM, they can export a csv or excel file for that level of filtration. Payment will be flat rate (what I am thinking right now) for the data exported by # of records. 

7. I hope to find data for all registered advisors in the United States so when the user clicks on an individual company they will also be able to see a "roster" of the advisers that are registered with that given RIA with contact information. This would be what would move the web app from just being a useful analytic tool to scope out the competition to something that is even more valuable for business.
